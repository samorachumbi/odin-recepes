This is a project to test my basic skills in Git and HTML.
In this project I am to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
This website is not meant to look pretty, it'll be more of a Brutalist Design.

Just Completed my first html web project... wasn't that difficult after all ğŸ˜‚ğŸ¤£ğŸ˜‚ğŸ‘Œ
