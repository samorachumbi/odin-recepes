<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nothing beats an easy to make and even easier to prepare roast chicken! Especially when roasted with
    garlic butter, rosemary, parsley, lemon, and a hint of white wine for an unbeatable flavour.
    This Garlic Herb Butter Roast Chicken definitely beats the pants off of any rotisserie chicken!
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Garlic + Butter = Garlic Butter</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>A touch of lemon</li>
    <li>A hint of dry white wine (optional, but adds so much flavour to the meat while keeping it so juicy)</li>
    <li>Rosemary</li>
    <li>Parsley</li>

</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven.</li>
    <li>Rinse and pat dry chicken with paper towel.</li>
    <li>Combine olive oil, melted butter, wine (if using) and lemon juice together,
        rubbing all over the chicken, under the skin and inside the cavity.</li>
    <li>Season chicken outside and inside with salt, pepper and parsley. Don’t be afraid to use generous amounts!</li>
    <li>Rub the minced garlic over the chicken and under the skin. I do this separately as the last step to maximise
        the garlic taste</li>
    <li>Stuff the garlic head into the chicken cavity along with the rosemary sprigs and the squeezed lemon halve.
        You can also use sprigs of Thyme or any other herb.</li>
    <li>Roast chicken, basting half way through cooking time, until cooked through.</li>
    <li>Broil until golden and crispy!</li>
</ol>
<p>I like to go in the carcass, over the chicken and under the skin with all of my ingredients to
    ensure maximum taste. You want every inch covered in flavour.</p>
<h3>how long to roast?</h3>
<p>Over one hour, depending on the size of your bird. This 4 pound (2kg) bird took one hour and 20 minutes cooking time,
    then a resting time of 10 minutes to keep all of those juices in before slicing.</p>
<p>Usually I’ll pass on chicken breasts because juicy crispy chicken legs are my favourite! BUT! In this roast chicken
    recipe? I eat it ALL.
    The breasts come out so moist. NO dry meat happening on this plate!</p>
<p>Do you see that crispy skin happening down there? ↓ That’s the part we fight over at the table. PLEASE tell me we are
    normal
    and your family fights over crispy skin too?</p>
<p>SOOOO soft and juicy inside!</p>
