<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups of flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups of warm water</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp of sugar (optional)</li>
    
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Add 3 cups of flour in a bowl.</li>    
    <li>Add salt, sugar, 2 tbsp of oil and 1 Â½ cups of water in a separate jar/ bowl.
         Stir until the salt and sugar dissolves.</li>    
        
    <li>Add the liquid mixture in step 2 in the flour bowl (step 1) and mix well.</li>    
    <li>Keep kneading for 10 minutes and add flour if needed until the dough becomes non-sticky.
         Add 2-3 tbsp of oil and continue kneading until the oil mixes well and the dough is soft.
          Cover the dough and leave it for 40 minutes.</li>    
    <li>After the 40 minutes, divide the dough into 10 - 15 equal parts making ball like shapes. 
        Arrange them in a flat surface dusted with flour(Cover with a damp tablecloth to avoid drying).</li>    
    <li> Dust flour in the flat place and take one of the balls and start rolling with a rolling pin 
        to a circular shape, brush oil on top and roll it inwards to form a shape-like a rope, 
        then create a coil-like shape and press the ball down with your palm to make it flat. Repeat this process to the rest of the remaining balls of dough.</li>    
    <li>Next, start rolling each of the coil-like shape doughs with the rolling pin to form a circular shape again.</li>    
    <li>In a hot pan, place the rolled out circular chapati and fry each side with little oil until its golden brown on medium heat. Place your cooked chapati 
        in a flat plat and cover with an aluminum foil.</li> 
    <li> Repeat this step to the rest of the coil-like dough.</li>   
    <li>Serve with your favourite stew</li>
